# Student-Performance-Analyzer
A simple C++ console application that allows the user to input multiple students’ names and their marks in Math, English, and Science. The program calculates each student’s total and average marks, validates the inputs, and then sorts the students in descending order based on total marks. It also highlights the top and lowest performing students.

# 🎓 Student Performance Analyzer

A simple C++ console application to manage and evaluate student performance based on their marks in **Math**, **English**, and **Science**.

## ✨ Features

- Collects data for multiple students
- Input validation: ensures marks are between `0` and `100`
- Calculates:
  - Total marks
  - Average marks
- Sorts students **by total marks** in descending order
- Displays:
  - Each student’s full data
  - The top-ranking student
  - The lowest-ranking student

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user is asked how many students they want to enter.
2. For each student, the program collects:
   - First name
   - Last name
   - Marks in Math, English, and Science (0–100)
3. It calculates:
   - `Total Marks = Math + English + Science`
   - `Average = Total / 3`
4. It sorts all students from **highest to lowest total marks**.
5. It displays:
   - All students sorted
   - The top and bottom performers
