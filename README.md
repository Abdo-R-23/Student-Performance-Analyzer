# Student-Performance-Analyzer
A simple C++ console application that allows the user to input multiple students’ names and their marks in Math, English, and Science. The program calculates each student’s total and average marks, validates the inputs, and then sorts the students in descending order based on total marks. It also highlights the top and lowest performing students.
